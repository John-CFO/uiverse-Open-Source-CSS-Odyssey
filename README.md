# Universal open source CSS Odyssey

a new challenge I completed on uiverse.io

Rules for this challenge:

Bring this HTML to life with your own styles

In this unique challenge, you and all participants work with the same predefined HTML structure for a map element.
Your goal is to demonstrate your creativity and expertise by designing the map in your own unique way without changing the HTML code.

Special Rules:
When you click Submit a map, you will see that the HTML already exists for the map. In this challenge, you only write the CSS.

The winner gets 2000 points
